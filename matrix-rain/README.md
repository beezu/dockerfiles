# matrix-rain-docker
The project was created entirely by [nojvek](https://github.com/nojvek) over on [their github repo](https://github.com/nojvek/matrix-rain).

This is just a docker container of their script.

Start with: `docker run --rm --log-driver none -it beezu/matrix-rain`

ctrl+c to close it.

I personally set up a bash alias to make launching matrix-rain easier.

I recommend setting log-driver to none as it can generate quite a lot of useless logs that take up space.
