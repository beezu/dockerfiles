# pmatrix-docker
The project was created entirely by [joechrisellis](https://github.com/joechrisellis) over on [their github repo](https://github.com/joechrisellis/pmatrix). This is just a docker container of their script.

Start with: `docker run --rm --log-driver none -it beezu/pmatrix`

ctrl+c to close it.

I personally set up a bash alias to make launching pmatrix easier.

I recommend setting log-driver to none as it can generate quite a lot of useless logs that take up space.
